# Advanced OpenLANE Workshop

### Prerequisites

  1. Ubuntu OS-based System
  2. 25GB+ Disk Space

### Installation

1. Clone below website on Ubuntu OS (VirtualBox or native env)

   a. https://github.com/nickson-jose/openlane_build_script
   b. https://github.com/kunalg123/vsdflow

2. Just Follow 1.a. . Don't doubt Just follow 1.a.
   1. build
   2. run

Install need a lot of time. So if you don't follow the direction, you will be lost huge time. like me...
